This website contains relevant historical data on the LDTA instances that pre-date the SLE conference.

LDTA was an ETAPS conference from 2001 up to and including 2012 after which the community continued as "SLE" by merging with the ATEM community and others.
In 2001, when LDTA was created, it merged WAGA (Workshop on Attribute Grammars and their Applications 90, SAGA'91, WAGA'99, and WAGA'2000) 
with the workshop on Algebraic Specifications in Amsterdam (ASF+SDF 95 and ASF+SDF 97).
